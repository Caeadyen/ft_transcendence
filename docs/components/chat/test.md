# Chat Todo(Nestjs)
> Standardizing the APIs

> Conforming codes to DRY

> Better organization of routes managements

> Proper Typescript-ing of codes

> Putting each API route behind the User's login session

> Modifying current Users' Session Authentication to Project Requirements

# Chat Todo(Vuejs)
> Break down large components into smaller child components(if necessary)

> Visual/UI Improvements 

> Proper(prettier) Datetime formatting

> Cleaner fonts (if necessary)

> Wiring the universal notifications count to root component AKA ChatIcon.vue

> Ideally some enter/exit keyframes CSS + Javascript Animations for smoother feel when navigating the app

> Regarding the project requirement part that says (The user should be able to invite other users to play a Pong game through the chat interface.), I have created just a placeholder for that ATM, pending when I receive briefings about how the players matching feature is implemented on the game matchmaking part
